            <img src="images/acensi-devcup.jpg" class="image-right">
            <p>Paris, France (December 2015)</p>
            <p>I won the 11th position between more than 450 programmers.</p>
            <p>The competition was made of three phases. The first was about solving algorithm and structures problems, in the second we have to create an strategy to win a game against the others programmers (12 hours of coding and re-coding). And finally, in Paris we had to make a tamagotchi from scratch in just 8 hours.</p>

            <h2>Api Fest</h2>
            <img src="images/api-fest.jpg" class="image-left">
            <p>Santiago, Chile (June 2015)</p>
            <p> We finished 8th among 9 other teams.</p>
            <p>It was a really cool hackathon, we had 24 hours to create an app using any API. We did a website where you could find the activities calendar of the university, because in the time, there were too many Facebook events and even others published in the official page. So we wanted to propose a solution making a page where you could find everything. Also, we used the facebook and google API to sign in, so we could have vip users who were the rights to make changes. </p>
            <p>Moreover, before that week end, me and my time we didn't know anything about web, and we learned a lot. And in addition, we won an online course to keep developping our programming knowledge</p>

            <iframe width="270" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/piHzxin0pno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Santiago, Chile (2012)</p>
            <p>I was still in the school and I saw that competition in the internet, I wasn't part of any robotic team, even my school didn't have one. But I was motivated and I talked with two mates that maybe would be interesting, then I went to talk to a teacher, and that was how I created our robotic team.</p>
            <p>The challenge was make a robot that could climb a "mountain" carrying an object. As you could see in the video (and yes, it's me in the minute 0:52)</p>
